## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- javascript

### What I learned

There are many things I learnt doing this challenge mainly:

- how to add a background image in the body

  - ```css
    /* to create the rows */
    body {
      background-image: url("images\\bg-intro-desktop.png");
    }
    ```

- application of flexbox

  - I used flexbox a ton on this project in order to achieve the desired output

    ```css
    /* to create the rows */
    .components {
      text-align: center;
      justify-content: center;
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      flex-direction: row;
    }
    ```

- The use of DOM
- The use of javascript to make the website active.

### Continued development

In the future:

- code more complex script to manage the inputs
